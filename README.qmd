## Dataset

We have a kaggle dataset on [credit card fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
This is a highly imbalaced dataset with fraud only $0.172\%$ of $284,807$ transactions.

This dataset is anonymized for personal privacy, so we have PCA components as our features.

We calculate mutual information and correlation on our features to find out what is interesting and predictive.
